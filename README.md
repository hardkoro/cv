# 😃 About me

<!-- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/progfay/shields-with-icon/master/README.md -->

I was working as a backend developer in a small company. I had achieved all my goals within it, and I was looking for new challenges now. This led me to appyling for Python Engineer at Picnic Technologies B.V. Currently I am starting my work here, and I am very excited about it.

As for my previous experience. I was responsible for the design and development of a WMS system (database and ERP integration), implemented address storage, integrated new logic into existing document workflow, coordinated the development of tablets software for storekeepers to perform warehouse operations. As a result, we reduce quantitive and qualitive errors in shipping up to 50%, reduced waste in production up to 10% and increased total customers' satisfaction.

Under my initiative, Python was added to the company’s technology stack. I used Python to integrate several EDI systems to ERP, made some ETL data pipelines, created a REST API service. Also, I deployed Apache Airflow and became an experienced user of Docker containers. I know when to use Django and when to prefer Flask.

If SQL was considered as a natural language, then I would call myself a bilingual. I know how to utilize views, triggers, procedures, pipe functions, explain plans, partitions — you name it! I know Oracle best of all, but PostgreSQL is my buddy too. Now I am expanding my skills in NoSQL, as I passed several MongoDB training courses in particular.

Had one subordinate: I know how to set tasks & control its execution without any conflicts.
