# 😃 About me

I am working as a backend developer in a small company. I have achieved all my goals within it, and I’m looking for new challenges now. Due to the current political situation in Russia, I’m looking for challenges in Europe, being now in Tbilisi, Georgia. I am set up for relocation, but we could discuss other options too.

I was responsible for the design and development of a WMS system (database and ERP integration), implemented address storage, integrated new logic into existing document workflow, coordinated the development of tablets software for storekeepers to perform warehouse operations. As a result, we reduce quantitive and qualitive errors in shipping up to 50%, reduced waste in production up to 10% and increased total customers' satisfaction.

Under my initiative, Python was added to the company’s technology stack. I used Python to integrate several EDI systems to ERP, made some ETL data pipelines, created a REST API service. Also, I deployed Apache Airflow and became an experienced user of Docker containers. I know when to use Django and when to prefer Flask.

If SQL was considered as a natural language, then I would call myself a bilingual. I know how to utilize views, triggers, procedures, pipe functions, explain plans, partitions — you name it! I know Oracle best of all, but PostgreSQL is my buddy too. Now I am expanding my skills in NoSQL, as I passed several MongoDB training courses in particular.

Had one subordinate: I know how to set tasks & control its execution without any conflicts.
